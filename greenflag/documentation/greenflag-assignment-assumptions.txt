Assumptions

1. The pyarrow module is installed, otherwise the following imports will throw an error - No module named 'pyarrow'

   If not installed and get an error of - No module named 'pyarrow'
   
   Then use one of the following:
   
   pyarrow with the conda package manager : conda install pyarrow -c conda-forge
   OR
   install binary wheels from PyPI with pip : pip install pyarrow


2. Follwoing is the Directory structure for this assignment
   C:\Projects\greenflag     ...   : main folder
      - requirement          ...   : Contains the requirements - "Data Engineer Test.zip" file
      - documentation        ...   : Contains the "greenflag-assignment-assumptions.txt" file about asumptions and few notes
      - scripts              ...   : Contains the Python script files
      - raw                  ...   : Contains the Raw CSV files
      - parquet              ...   : Contains the Parquet files - the Raw CSV files after converted to Parquet are stored here
      - sqlite_weather_db    ...   : Contais the weather database file
      - testing              ...   : Contais two text files
                                          - greenflag_assignment_test_scenarios_and_results.txt : contains the test scenarios and test results
                                          - greenflag_assignment_log_messages.txt               : contains the log messages of one successful run


3. There are 3 python files in addition to the main python programme:
   greenflag-assignment.py   ...   : This is the main python script containing the main logic
   config.py                 ...   : This file contains all the required configurations
   common_utils.py           ...   : This file is used to put some common functions - here I have put the logging function
   db_utils.py               ...   : This file contains all the database related functions


4. For the statement in the pdf "Convert the weather data into parquet format", I have assumed that, 
   I have convert to every csv into respective parquet file - as one to one.


5. I have displayed/logged every stage of the process
   - Reading CSV files & Printing the numberof reacords in each file
   - Converting & Writing into Parquet files
   - Reading Parquet files into Pandas
   - Querying the data (for 3 results) from the Pandas and display the results which are displayed towrds the end in the


6. I have also created a SQLite database to create a weather table and load with the data from the files.
   And then query the weather table from the command prompt. The details of the same are provided as one of the
   test scenario in the "greenflag_assignment_test_scenarios_and_results.txt" file


7. I have run the programme for few test scenarios. The scenarios & the programme execution results are copied
   in the "greenflag_assignment_test_scenarios_and_results.txt" file
   

8. I have also provided the complete log messages of one successful run
   in the "greenflag_assignment_log_messages.txt" file
